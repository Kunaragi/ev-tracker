EV Tracker Issues, Features and Bugs:

General:
✓ Backup file before a save.
✓ Configurable tracker file location through --infile flag.
✓ Switch the EvDict to a separate pokedex module (pokedex branch)
	✓ Use a better data format than csv
	✓ Load EV data for pokemon from sqlite backend.
	✓ Implement ev-tracker.py using the pokemon, pokedex modules.
- Support for multiple forms, i.e. Meloetta, Wormadam etc.
- Implement lazy loading of tracker data (i.e. for ev, help command)
- Ditch automatically active tracked Pokemon.

Commands:
✓ ev
✓ list
✓ current
- track
	✓ species
	✓ name
	✓ pokerus
	- item
✓ status
- update
	- species
	- name
	- pokerus
	- item
- battle
	- ev update
	- multiple at once
- vitamin

Potential features:
- history - record past battles/changes for a pokemon.
- undo - undo the previous command.
- Add an "interactive" mode for continuous input.
- Python 3.0 compatability - should be easy since all dependencies are from the standard library.
