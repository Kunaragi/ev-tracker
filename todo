EV Tracker Issues, Features and Bugs:

General:
✓ Backup file before a save.
✓ Configurable tracker file location through --infile flag.
- Switch the EvDict to a separate pokedex module (pokedex branch)
	✓ Use a better data format than csv
	✓ Load EV data for pokemon from sqlite backend.
	- Implement ev-tracker.py using the pokemon, pokedex modules.
- Support for multiple forms, i.e. Meloetta, Wormadam etc.
